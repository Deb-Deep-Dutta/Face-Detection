# Face-Detection
This is a face detection code written in python.  
It uses the Haar Cascade XML model of OpenCV to detect faces.  
  
Pre requisites:  
 1. Python: Python needs to be installed on your system preferrably version 3.10 and up.  
 2. OpenCv library: Install the OpenCV libraby using  "pip install opencv-python".  
 3. Code editor: I use Visual Studio Code as my code editor. You can use notepad also.  
 4. Haar Cascade: I have used "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" it will be present in the folder.  
  
Hope this helps.ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
